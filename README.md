## Repository layout

This repository is formed by a set of workspaces. A workspace holds a plugin or
a set of plugins based on a specific topic/team. For example, catalog,
kubernetes, and TechDocs can be referred to as workspaces. Each plugin belongs
to a workspace and workspaces are portable enough to be moved to its own repo if
desired.

A workspace has its own instance of backstage which the plugins in that workspace 
can be installed and configured into for testing purposes.

## Release Management

Changesets have proven to be a reliable method for managing different versions
of packages. Each plugin workspace has its own changesets and isolated releases.

When you make changes in your plugins you should run `yarn changeset` to create
a changeset. This will prompt you to select the packages that have been
modified and add changelog notes. This will be checked as part of the PR.

Whenever a new changeset is introduced to the main, a fresh "Version packages
($workspace_name)" PR is produced. Merging a Version packages PR will trigger
the release of all the plugins in the workspaces (provided changesets have been
added), and also update the `CHANGELOG` files.
